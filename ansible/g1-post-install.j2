Your {{ brand_parent }} {{ brand_project }} deployment has completed
successfully as of {{ finish_time }}.

You may now manage your volumes using the gluster(8) command line interface.

Below is your default storage volume information:

====================
{{ vol_info }}
====================

{% if use_nfs %}
Your volume has been configured for the NFS client.
{% endif %}
{% if use_smb %}
Your volume has been configured for the SMB client.
{% endif %}

{% if use_nfs or use_smb %}
The volume can be accessed via the virtual IP addresses (VIPs) configured
during the deployment:

{% for vip in vips %}
{{ vip }}
{% endfor %}

These VIPs are part of a high-availability subsystem and will automatically
migrate between a subset of your Gluster nodes in the case of a node outage.

No load balancing for these VIPs is provided by Gluster. It is recommended
that you implement an external load balancer.

{% else %}
Your volume has been configured for the Gluster native client (FUSE). The volume
can be accessed via the storage network hostnames or IP addressed configured
during the deployment:

{% for hostname in hostnames %}
{{ hostname }}.{{ domain_name }}
{% endfor %}

The Gluster native client utilizes client-side intelligence for data placement
and by design is highly available and load balanced among the Gluster nodes.

Use of the Gluster native client requires the client-side packages to be
installed on any node that will be mounting the Gluster volume.

All native clients must be able to resolve the Gluster node hostnames to their
correct IP addresses.
{% endif %}

{% if use_smb %}
Mounting volumes via SMB requires first managing users and permissions for the
volume access. Please see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Administrator's Guide
and the Windows Integration Guide for details on the required configurations.

Example command for mounting your volume on a Windows system:

net use Z: \\{{ ad_netbios_name }}.{{ ad_domain_name }}\{{ default_volname }}


Example command for mounting your volume on a Linux system:

mount -t {{ mount_protocol }} //{{ ad_netbios_name }}.{{ ad_domain_name }}/{{ default_volname }} [mountpoint] -o {{ mount_opts }}


Please note that for better performance and experience, the standard automated
method for exporting Gluster volumes via Samba has been replaced with a manual
re-export of a local native client (FUSE) mount. You can read more about this
configuration at: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2969381
{% else %}
Example command for mounting your volume on a Linux system:

mount -t {{ mount_protocol }} {{ mount_host }}:/{{ default_volname }} [mountpoint] -o {{ mount_opts }}


Example /etc/fstab entry for mounting your volume at boot time:

{{ mount_host }}:/{{ default_volname }}    [mountpoint]    {{ mount_protocol }}    {{ mount_opts }}  0 0
{% endif %}


Your default volume has been configured on {{ nodes_min }} out of your {{ nodes_deployed }}
total Gluster nodes.

{% if nodes_deployed|int > nodes_min|int %}
Gluster brick file systems have been pre-configured on the remaining nodes
and may be used to expand the default volume or create new volumes.

{% endif %}
Please see the documentation for instructions regarding the creation,
expansion, and deletion of Gluster volumes.
